# Public vs. Private Shopify Apps: Which One is Right for Your Business?

When developing a Shopify app for your online store, you'll have to decide between creating a public app or a private app. Each type of app has its own unique features, advantages, and use cases. In this article, we'll help you determine which app type is best suited for your business needs, without diving into technical details.

## Public Apps

**Overview:**

Public apps are designed for a wider audience and can be listed in the Shopify App Store. They are built to serve multiple stores and can be installed by any Shopify merchant.

**Advantages:**

1. **Discoverability:** Public apps can be listed on the Shopify App Store, making them visible to a large audience of potential users.
2. **Scalability:** Public apps are built to serve multiple stores, allowing your app to grow with your user base.
3. **Earning Potential:** By offering a paid app or integrating in-app purchases, you can monetize your public app and generate revenue.
4. **Standardized Authentication:** Public apps use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, ensuring secure and seamless integration with the Shopify platform.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Review Process:** Public apps must undergo a review process to be listed in the Shopify App Store. This may result in additional development time and effort to meet the required guidelines.
2. **Competition:** The Shopify App Store is highly competitive, and your app may face competition from other similar apps.

**Best Suited For:**

Public apps are best suited for businesses looking to create an app with a broad appeal that can serve a wide range of merchants. If you want to reach a larger audience and monetize your app, a public app is the way to go.

## Private Apps

**Overview:**

Private apps are custom-built for a specific store or a small number of stores. They are not listed in the Shopify App Store and are intended for internal use or for a select group of clients.

**Advantages:**

1. **Customization:** Private apps can be tailored to the unique needs of a specific store, allowing for a high degree of customization.
2. **No Review Process:** Since private apps are not listed in the Shopify App Store, they do not have to undergo a review process. This can result in faster development and deployment times.
3. **Controlled Access:** Private apps are only accessible by the store(s) they were developed for, ensuring controlled access to the app's features and data.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Limited Audience:** Private apps are not listed in the Shopify App Store, which limits their potential user base.
2. **No Monetization Opportunities:** Since private apps are not publicly available, there are fewer opportunities to monetize them.

**Best Suited For:**

Private apps are ideal for businesses that need a custom solution for their own store or for a small group of clients. If your primary goal is to create an app that serves a specific purpose for your own store or a select group of merchants, a private app is the right choice.

## Conclusion

When deciding whether to create a public or private Shopify app, consider your business goals, target audience, and the level of customization required. Public apps offer the potential for a larger audience, scalability, and monetization opportunities, while private apps provide customization, controlled access, and a quicker development process. By evaluating your business needs and understanding the differences between public and private apps, you can make an informed decision and choose the right app type for your business.
